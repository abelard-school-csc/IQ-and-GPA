# GPA and IQ Data Analysis  

## Overview  
This project explores the relationship between GPA and IQ using statistical analysis and visualizations. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes additional variables such as gender and concept scores.  

## Dataset  
- **Source:** [GPA and IQ Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/gpa-and-iq)  
- **Description:** This dataset contains observations of GPA, IQ, gender, and concept scores for individuals. The goal is to analyze how IQ correlates with GPA and identify any significant trends.
